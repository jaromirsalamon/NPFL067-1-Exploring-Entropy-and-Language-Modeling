# Assignment #1: NPFL067 Statistical NLP
Exploring Entropy and Language Modeling
Task definition is here: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~hajic/courses/npfl067/assign1.html

Source data:
- TEXTCZ1.txt - czech list of words one per line with charset=iso-8859-2
- TEXTEN1.txt - english list of words one per line with charset=ascii

Implementation is following:
- entropy.py - imlementation of part 1. Entropy of a Text
- lm.py - implementation of part 2. Cross-Entropy and Language Modeling
- npfl067.py - library supporting uni- and bi- gram claculation and part 1 and 2

Additional performance evaluation (not a part of task, not sent for evaluation):
- performance.py - testing functions durations under different input setup or data volume
- stats.py - uni- and bi- gram statistics calculation
- timer.py - library supporting time measure

Output:
- jsalamon.assign1.docx - 19 pages lab work report
- jsalamon.assign1.pdf - pdf version of docx
- jsalamon.assign1.xlsx - tabulated and in graphs evaluated results

This is final version sent for evaluation. Evaluated for 70/100 points (incl. 15 points penalty for late submission, so total work points would be 85/100).
